Once the mixture is moistened, lightly flour a countertop or large cutting board and remove the dough from the bowl with lightly oiled or wet hands (to discourage sticking). Knead for 2-3 minutes to remove clumps. The dough won't become elastic, but should easily form a loose ball.",				"Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a damp, clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out and developing a skin.",				"Place on counter and let sit 24 hours at room temperature. It will double in size and you may see bubbles forming on the surface.",				"Lightly flour a large cutting board or your kitchen countertop, and place the dough on it. Wet or lightly oil your hands again.",				"Divide dough into seven equal portions and make your dough balls.",				"Place the dough balls into oiled cylindrical airtight containers (deli takeaway containers are ideal), date the containers, and place in the fridge for 48 to 96 hours.",				"Remove from refrigerator at least 1 hour before use to allow the dough to come to room temperature; this lets the gluten relax and makes the dough malleable."			]		}	}"@)ForEach ($recipe in $recipesToAdd){	Invoke-RestMethod -Method "Post" -Uri $server/recipes -Body $recipe}
